        description: "The course introduces and develops methods for designing and implementing abstract data types using the Java programming language. The main focus is on how to build and encapsulate data objects and their associated operations. Specific topics include linked structures, recursive structures and algorithms, binary trees, balanced trees, and hash tables. These topics are fundamental to programming and are essential to other courses in computer science. The course involves weekly programming assignments, in-class quizzes, discussion section exercises, and multiple exams. Prerequisites: COMPSCI 121 (or equivalent Java experience). A grade of B or better in COMPSCI 121 (or a grade of C or better in COMPSCI 186 (or COMPSCI 190D) is required for students enrolling in COMPSCI 187 and Basic Math Skills (R1). Basic Java language concepts are introduced quickly; if unsure of background, contact instructor. 4 credits."
